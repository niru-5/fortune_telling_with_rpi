# Introduction

This project aims to create an automated palm reading fortune teller using artificial intelligence. The system will:

1. Capture images of users' palms using a camera connected to the Raspberry Pi
2. Process and segment the hand images to isolate the palm lines and features
3. Send the processed palm images to ChatGPT via API for analysis
4. Return personalized daily fortune readings based on the AI's interpretation
